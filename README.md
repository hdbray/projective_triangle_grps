# Projective triangle groups

The project is in progress

### Overview

This software will generate the tiling of a convex set in real projective
space by a triangle group acting on the standard projective triangle. The
inputs are the three generating projective reflections for the group.
Representations of the group are explicitly calculated in the paper of Xin
Nie 'on the Hilbert geometry of simplicial Tits sets' [2014] based on the
seminal work of Tits and Vinberg on representations of linear reflection
groups. We provide several examples as well.
